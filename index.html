  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I was always wondering to be a freelancer after I saw my friend freelancing as a <strong>web-scraper.</strong></p>
    <p>From then I always want to be a freelancer but what I know I didnt find any of that related that so I have to find a new skill so I look for a new skill which should be good enough to be a feelancer I was finding jobs that I can do thorough many searches I found that <em>php</em> language should be good so I started that and I started to find a decent institute<br> And thats how I come to know about <a href="https://getmimo.com/"><strong>Mimo</strong></a> and now i am able to make this blog.</p>
